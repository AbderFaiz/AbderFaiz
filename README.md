## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in formal methods, software verification, and static analysis. I work at Randstad Digital France as a subcontractor for Airbus Commercial Aircraft in the Avionics Software Departement since 2021.

At my job, I'm responsible of the development and maintenance of the avionics software production system for on-board and ground avionics products and components, in an environment with industrial and certification constraints (DO178, DAL A to D software, DO330) that are used in critical on-board products (e.g. flight controls, flight alerting, communication, maintenance equipment) for all Airbus aircrafts

I work mainly with C/C++, Python, OCaml, and scripting tools to build reliable software and automation.

I love creating and building things. Iâ€™ve started a blog and a podcast in the past, and I also enjoy drawing, I keep a travel journal where I sketch and capture moments from my trips. I'm also passionate about languages, culture, philosophy, and I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives.
