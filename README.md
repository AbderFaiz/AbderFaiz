## Hi there 👋

 I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in formal methods, software verification, and static analysis.

 See my [Learn in public experiment](https://afaiz.dev/).

I love creating and building things.

I'm self-hosting my repos at [lab.afaiz.dev](https://lab.afaiz.dev/) using gogs
