## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in formal methods, software verification, and static analysis.

I love creating and building things. Iâ€™ve started a blog and a podcast in the past, and I also enjoy drawing, I keep a travel journal where I sketch and capture moments from my trips. I'm also passionate about languages, culture, philosophy, and I enjoy exploring new ideas and perspectives.
